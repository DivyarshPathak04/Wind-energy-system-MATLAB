🌬️ Wind Energy System Simulation using MATLAB

📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a generalized MATLAB simulation of a Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS).
The project models wind power extraction and turbine output while considering cut-in, rated, and cut-out wind speeds.

The main objective of this project is conceptual learning and hands-on practice in renewable energy system modeling using MATLAB.

⚙️ Features

- Wind power calculation using standard physical equations
- Ideal and practical wind turbine power curves
- Modeling of cut-in, rated, and cut-out wind speeds
- Fully parameterized and reusable MATLAB code
- Graphical visualization of system behavior

🧮 Mathematical Model

The available wind power is calculated using:

[
P = \frac{1}{2} \rho A v^3
]

Where:

- ρ = Air density (kg/m³)
- A = Swept area of turbine blades (m²)
- v = Wind speed (m/s)

The extracted turbine power is obtained using a power coefficient C_p.
